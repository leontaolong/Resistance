# The Resistance

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage political resistance actions, created as part of an assignment for the [Software Architecture](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100150) course at the UW iSchool.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? What did you do to make sure your code followed the design principles discussed in class? #####
> First, I used the noun-verb analysis technique to identify a few subjects in the business space as my classes and further add their fields and functions based on the requirements.
> Then I attemped to create some inheritence and interface to better structure the classes. 
> Additionally, I made sure the classes are encapsulated by making fields private and creating getters and setters.
> I also kept in mind to factorize the functions and avoid redundant code.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
